# Spryker Feature: Product Options

assign Product Labels to highlight specific products in your shop. Customize the look and text of the Labels as they appear in the shop. Any association can be a Label, such as "Sale" or "Christmas". Products that are new in your shop can automatically be marked with the Dynamic Product Label "New" for a pre-defined time range.
